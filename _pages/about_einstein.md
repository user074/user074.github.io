I am a PhD student in the Computer Science program at the CUNY Graduate Center. My research interests include computer vision, language vision models, and AI agents. I am interested in applying machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems. I am advised by Prof. [Hao Tang](https://www.bmcc.cuny.edu/faculty/hao-tang/) and Prof. [Zhigang Zhu](https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/profiles/zhigang-zhu). Currently I am a member of the [CCVCL](http://ccvcl.org/) at the City College of New York.

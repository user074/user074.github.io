I am a PhD student in the Computer Science program at the CUNY Graduate Center. My research interests include language, vision, and reasoning. I am interested in applying machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems. I am advised by Prof. [Hao Tang](https://www.bmcc.cuny.edu/faculty/hao-tang/) and Prof. [Zhigang Zhu](https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/profiles/zhigang-zhu), co-advised by Prof. [Ping Ji](https://sites.google.com/view/ping-ji). Currently I am a member of the [CCVCL](http://ccvcl.org/) at the City College of New York. 

I am interested in collaborating with researchers and students. Please feel free to reach out to me if you are interested in collaborating or discussing research ideas.
